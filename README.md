# Overview 

This repository contains scripts of some of the cryptocurrencies projects I've been working on, particularly the ones that I have not scalated. Some of them include:
* Downloading coin's prices from cryptocompare API.
* Programming correlations matrix and heatmap graph to understand price relationships between selected assets.
